# AskJS

**AskJS** is a fun interactive web project where users can interact with buttons and see dynamic responses. This project demonstrates basic JavaScript event handling, CSS styling, and HTML structure.

## Project Overview

The AskJS project features three interactive buttons with specific behaviors:
- **Yes**: Turns the button pink, displays a celebratory GIF, and starts a background color-changing effect.
- **No**: Moves randomly within the container when hovered over.
- **We'll see**: Stops the background color-changing effect, turns the button pink, and shows a different GIF.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Each button performs a unique action when clicked.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes periodically when the "Yes" button is clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies
